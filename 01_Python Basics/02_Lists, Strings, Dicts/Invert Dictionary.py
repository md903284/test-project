# Description of the Task
In this task, you will create a sample dictionary and then write a Python program to invert the dictionary, 
meaning the keys will become values and the values will become keys. 
This is useful in scenarios where you need to quickly look up keys based on their associated values.

# Instructions
Create a sample dictionary with some key-value pairs.
Write a function to invert the dictionary.
Print the original dictionary.
Print the inverted dictionary.

# Learning Objective
The objective of this task is to practice working with dictionaries in Python, particularly focusing on:
Accessing and manipulating dictionary keys and values.
Understanding the constraints of dictionary values being unique when they are converted into keys.

# Sample Usage

original_dict = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 3
}
inverted_dict = invert_dictionary(original_dict)
print("Original Dictionary:", original_dict)
print("Inverted Dictionary:", inverted_dict)
