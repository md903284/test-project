# Description of the Task
Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input from the user and 
finds the largest number using a for loop and if-else statements.

# Instructions
Prompt the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.
Convert the input string into a list of integers.
Initialize a variable to store the largest number found so far.
Use a for loop to iterate through the list of numbers.
Use an if-else statement to update the largest number whenever a larger number is found.
Print the largest number at the end.

# Learning Objective
Understand how to take input from the user and convert it into a list of integers.
Learn to use for loops to iterate through a list.
Practice using if-else statements to compare and update values.

# Sample Usage
Enter numbers separated by spaces: 34 67 23 89 12 90 55
The largest number is: 90
