# Description of the Task
Write a Python program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100. 
A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

# Instructions
Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number, use another loop to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
Print the number if it is prime.

# Learning Objective
